### Hi there, I am Daisy ðŸ‘‹

I'm a graduating senior at Columbia University majoring in CS. I am currently based in New York and am really excited to start a career in software engineering. 

I previously interned at DoorDash and Warner Bros. Discovery where I learned about iOS development and web development.
